# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
ApplicationB/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
ApplicationB/db/*.sqlite3
ApplicationB/db/*.sqlite3-journal
ApplicationB/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
ApplicationB/log/*
ApplicationB/tmp/*
ApplicationB!/log/.keep
ApplicationB!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
ApplicationB/tmp/pids/*
ApplicationB!/tmp/pids/
ApplicationB!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
ApplicationB/storage/*
ApplicationB!/storage/.keep
ApplicationB/.byebug_history
